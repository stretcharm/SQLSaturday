# SQLSaturday

Here is a dashboard of the SQL Saturday sessions from around the world. If your not aware of SQL Saturday check out their upcoming sessions www.sqlsaturday.com and see if there is one near you.  

Having attended many sessions I have found them very useful and often want to get the presentations from sessions I've attended or missed. However as there are many events all over the world I though it would be useful to see the sessions and material for these.

I've made a searchable dashboard to that can drill down to events, speakers and sessions to get links to any downloads.
Note some speakers don't upload their presentations, but may make them available via their own blogs or github sites. So if you find a good session try the speaker contact links to see if they have the presentation. 
To get to the downloads use Right Mouse Menu to Drillthrough to the Session Page. Downloads links are at the bottom.

Most of the data comes from the xml feeds for each event, but also complemented by web scrapping data from session pages.

I've made use of a few PowerBI techniques such as XML and web processing, M Functions, Unicode Icons. Image and Web Links.
To improve the speed of loading I've moved historical data into the a spreadsheet which I published on Data,world https://data.world/stretcharm/sqlsaturday

Events start at No 375 in March 2015 when the xml session feeds started.
